### How it works

When you load *Task Master* you first need to set your goals. You can make as many as you like but you need to make at least 3. Then its time to get to work! An in app pomodoro timer helps to keep you on task with interspersed breaks and motivational quotes keep you inpired. As you complete your tasks you cross them off and they move to the completed section of your list so you can focus on whats at hand and see your progress! On the leaderboard you can see your standing, what percentage of your tasks youve completed. Once you hit 100% your spot is locked in, meaning the faster you complete your tasks, the higher up youll be!
